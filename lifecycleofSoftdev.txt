web app:
eg : google map , fb 
lang : RUBY , PHP,PYTHON 
database : 
tools : text editor 

mobile app :

Android : eclipse /Android Studio(JAVA)

website : 
HTML , CSS , JabaScript 

Designer : focuses on look : uses photoshop or illustrator 
frontend dev. - HTML , CSS , JavaScript 
Backend dev . : Connect to database : ruby , python , php , JAVA 


Life cycle of. software development 
a. requirement gathering:
analyse requirements and features in demand
Market research | product reuirement| product Architecture and function specification| product Design |
Coding and implimnetation -> <- bug fixes | testing  and quality 

 marketing requirment document (MRD ) : formal data rep. of market data gather 
  Market research & Analysis| competitive analysis{ economics of software creation}

b. writing functional specification:
 functioning of product on an abstract level
c. creating Archi. and design doc .:
components of product decided 
functionality defined: 
Interfaces(rukes and regulation how these components will interact with each other ) are designed for these components to work together 
d. implimentation and coding:
  soft dev - 1. design documents 2 .developments tools 
  each developer writes own code and collaborate with other devloper.
  hence the need of : Revision control system ->concurrent Versions system(CVS)
  
e. Testing and quality assurance:
1.unit testing : testing one component of product 
2. sanity testing : check to see if the linkage is proper : e.i conflicting or multiple function same name , or global variable 
3. functional testing 
f. software release 
g.Documentation:

bug fixes , detail of new feature - new functionality 
h.Support and new features
